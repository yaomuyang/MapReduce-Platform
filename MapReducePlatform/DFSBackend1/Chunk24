^^^^^^^^^^THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA: THE NOVEL AS A WHOLE

The last "novel" to be published during Hemingway's lifetime was The Old Man and the Sea, a work which Hemingway would identify as a new form. The precise generic classification is more or less inconsequential, although it is apparent that the work is a completely developed fable in the form of a very short novel.

-Delbert E. Wylder, in Hemingway's Heroes.

The secret about the novel, Ernest explained, was that there wasn't any symbolism. Sea equaled sea, old man was old man, the boy was a boy, the marlin was itself, and the sharks were no better and no worse than other sharks.

-Carlos Baker, Ernest Hemingway.

Indeed, the critical reception of the novel has emphasized this (metaphorical) aspect of it: in particular, Philip Young, Leo Gurko, and Carlos Baker have stressed the qualities of The Old Man and the Sea as allegory and parable.

-Clinton S. Burhans, in Hemingway and His Critics.

^^^^^^^^^^THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA: SANTIAGO AS SAINT/SINNER

Before the old fisherman is himself identified by obvious allusion with the crucified Christ, he is identified with Cain and with the crucifiers of Christ.

-Arvin P. Wells, in Twentieth Century Interpretations.

The protagonist of the book brings to full circle Hemingway's use of the mythic hero, for Santiago is again a hero with a different face. He is a modern adaptation of... the saint or ascetic.

-Delbert E. Wylder, in Hemingway's Heroes.

^^^^^^^^^^THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA: SANTIAGO AS CHRIST FIGURE

One may wonder whether the Christ image is entirely appropriate. It would appear that it reinforces the thrust of the book of Christ as conceived in his human aspect only. The suffering Christ is consistent with Hemingway's tragic vision.

-Samuel Shaw, in Ernest Hemingway.

Moreover, there are suggestions of Calvary... in the old man's struggling up the hill and falling under the weight of his mast, and further suggestions of the Crucifixion.
