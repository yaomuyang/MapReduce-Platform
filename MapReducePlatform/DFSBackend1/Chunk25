^^^^^^^^^^THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA: SANTIAGO'S DREAM LIONS

The "lions on the beach" have been variously interpreted. The reader may permit himself the widest latitude without going wrong or doing violence to the words--a dream of adventure, of boundless energy and pride, of love for the universe, of the million bounties of life. It is a phrase whose general meaning is clear but in which each man may find something special for himself.

-Samuel Shaw, in Ernest Hemingway.

^^^^^^^^^^THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA: A NEGATIVE VIEW

This hint that Hemingway may be padding his characterization of Santiago by means of fakery is abundantly confirmed by the action that follows. His combat with the fish is an ordeal that would do in even a vigorous young man.

-Robert P. Weeks, in Twentieth Century Interpretations.
